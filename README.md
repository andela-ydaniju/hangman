Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hangman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hangman_y

## Usage

After Installation, Run the "hangman" gem in your Command Line Interface. After the welcome screen has been displayed, proceed by entering the desired option "start", "load", or "quit".

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
